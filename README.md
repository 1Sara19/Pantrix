# Pantrix – Smart Cooking Assistant
SWE363 – Web Engineering and Development Project.  
This project focuses on building a fully interactive front-end web application.

---
##  Description

Pantrix is a smart web application that helps users decide what to cook based on the ingredients they already have at home. The system matches available ingredients with suitable recipes and ranks them using a Smart Match Score, highlighting the most relevant and practical options.

Users can filter results based on cooking time, meal categories, and dietary restrictions, while clearly seeing which ingredients are missing for each recipe. The platform aims to reduce food waste, save time, and simplify daily meal planning.

Registered users can save favorite recipes, manage their dietary preferences and allergies, and create meal plans. Guest users can browse and view recipes without requiring an account.

---

##  Currently Supported Ingredients

At the current stage, Pantrix supports a predefined set of ingredients only, since the project is front-end only and does not yet include backend integration or AI-based recipe generation.

The ingredient matching is currently based on the static recipe data available in the system. Therefore, users will get results only when their entered ingredients match the ingredients already defined in the existing recipe dataset.

The currently supported ingredients are:

* chicken
* garlic
* pasta
* cream
* tomato
* cucumber
* olive oil
* feta
* dough
* mozzarella
* basil
* rosemary
* thyme
* shrimp
* butter
* lemon
* onion
* carrot
* potato
* celery
* vegetable broth
* lettuce
* salad dressing

##  Figma Design

A reference Figma design has been created to present the main screens and core functionalities of the Pantrix application. While the design closely reflects the structure of the final implementation, minor differences may exist.

##  Notes

* The project is front-end only (no backend integration yet)
* Data is handled using localStorage
* No API keys or environment variables are required to run this project
* The current version supports only predefined ingredients from the static recipe dataset, since no backend integration or AI-based recipe generation is implemented yet

---
## Back-End Implementation

In this phase, we implemented the backend for Pantrix using `Node.js`, `Express.js`, and `MongoDB`. The backend now handles authentication, user management, recipe storage, favorites, reviews/comments, meal plans, contact reports, filter management, and admin settings.

The backend connects the front-end interface with real API endpoints and database operations, replacing the previous static-only behavior with a full-stack structure.

---
## Setup & Running the Backend(Using Terminal)

1. Go to the backend folder using the command:
```
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies using the command:
```
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file inside the backend folder.

4. Write the file like this:
```
PORT=5001
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
AI_API_KEY=your_ai_api_key
SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=your_spoonacular_api_key
SERP_API_KEY=your_serp_api_key
```

5. Start the backend server for development using the command:
```
npm run dev
```
6. The server will run at:
```
http://localhost:5001
```

7. For production or deployment, use:
```
npm start
```

## Current Limitations
* AI recipe generation and ingredient suggestions are working and can generate recipes based on user input. Generated recipes can also be saved in the database. However, the external AI/API service currently has a limited remaining credit balance, so only a small number of new recipes can still be generated beyond the recipes already stored in the database.
---
## Additional Notes

* Backend runs locally on port `5001`
* Frontend runs using Vite
* Protected routes require a valid JWT token
* Admin routes require both authentication and admin authorization
* API keys must be stored inside `.env` and should not be pushed to GitHub
* The backend is connected to MongoDB using Mongoose
* The frontend communicates with the backend through service files inside `src/services/`
* Recipe search performance may sometimes be affected because the recipe suggestion/search feature is connected to an external LLM/AI API. Response time can vary depending on the API availability, network connection, and request size.
