# Pantrix – Smart Cooking Assistant

SWE363 – Web Engineering and Development Project.  
This project focuses on building a fully interactive front-end web application.

---

##  Description

Pantrix is a smart web application that helps users decide what to cook based on the ingredients they already have at home. The system matches available ingredients with suitable recipes and ranks them using a Smart Match Score, highlighting the most relevant and practical options.

Users can filter results based on cooking time, meal categories, and dietary restrictions, while clearly seeing which ingredients are missing for each recipe. The platform aims to reduce food waste, save time, and simplify daily meal planning.

Registered users can save favorite recipes, manage their dietary preferences and allergies, and create meal plans. Guest users can browse and view recipes without requiring an account.
